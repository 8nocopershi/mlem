Darksiders II is a game that combines hack-and-slash combat, platforming, puzzle-solving, and exploration elements. The player controls Death as he travels through various realms, such as Earth, Heaven, Hell, and the Forge Lands. Death can use his scythes as his primary weapon, as well as secondary weapons such as hammers, axes, maces, and claws. He can also use his horse Despair to traverse large distances, and his raven Dust to guide him to his objectives.
 
The game also features a dynamic combat system that allows Death to perform different moves and combos depending on his weapons and enemies. Death can dodge, block, parry, and counterattack his foes, as well as execute them when their health is low. He can also use his Wrath abilities to unleash powerful attacks or buffs, such as summoning ghouls, teleporting slashes, or creating a protective aura. Additionally, Death can transform into his Reaper form for a limited time, increasing his damage and speed.
 
Darksiders II also has a rich story that expands the lore of the Darksiders universe. The game takes place during the 100-year imprisonment of War, the protagonist of the first game, who was accused of starting the Apocalypse prematurely. Death sets out to prove his brother's innocence by finding a way to restore humanity, which was wiped out by the Charred Council. Along the way, he encounters many characters and factions that have their own agendas and motivations, such as the Makers, the Angels, the Demons, the Dead Lords, and the Corruption.
